libsmbclient-php: a PHP wrapper for libsmbclient
================================================

libsmbclient-php is a PHP extension that uses samba's libsmbclient library
to provide samba related functions to PHP programs.

Getting started
---------------

- Check out the source code using git:

	git clone git://github.com/eduardok/libsmbclient-php.git

- phpize it:

	cd libsmbclient-php ; phpize

- Build the module

	./configure
	make

- As root install the module into the extensions directory:

	make install

- Activate libsmbclient-php in php.ini:

	extension="libsmbclient.so"

If you want to contribute
-------------------------

libsmbclient-php has been improved on a "as needed" basis, so it could be
that there is a feature not yet implemented, etc. 
As a way of keeping a history for other people using libsmbclient-php it
is better to get in contact through the mailing list instead of the 
developer(s) directly.
